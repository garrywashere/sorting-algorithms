# Sorting Algorithms
Examples of sorting algorithms for A-Level OCR Computer Science, written in Python üêç.

## Introduction
I wanted to practice Python to keep myself sharp, so I decided to write the sorting algorithms I need to remember for A-Level in Python. The intention is to better understand how they work and potentially help anyone else in my position who stumbles over my code.

## How to use this repo
Pull the repository or view the code on GitHub, then navigate the folders of each algorithm. I will attach a Markdown file with my best explanation of each algorithm's function, as well as provide source code for it.

You're very welcome to clone and modify the code, and feel free to let me know if you have any improvements :)

## Algorithms Included
- Bubble Sort ‚úÖ
- Merge Sort ‚úÖ
- Insertion Sort ‚úÖ
- Quick Sort ‚úÖ

## To-do
- ~~Rewrite scripts to be able to run independently and as a function for `run-all.py` as a playground, allowing comparison of algorithm efficiency.~~
- ~~Actually add documentation explaining code~~
- ~~Work on comments~~
- Implement threading
