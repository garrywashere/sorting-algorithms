# Sorting Algorithms
Examples of sorting algorithms for A-Level OCR computer science, written in Python 🐍.

## Introduction
I wanted to practise Python to keep myself sharp on it so I decided I'd write the sorting algorithms I need to remember for A-Level in Python. With the intention of better understanding how they work as well as potentially helping anyone else in my position who stumbles over my code.

## How to use this repo
Pull the repository or view the code on github, then just navigate the folders of each algorithm. I will attach a markdown file with my best explanation of each algorithm's function as well as provide source code for it.

You're very welcome to clone and modify the code, as well as feel free to let me know if you have any improvements :)

## Algorithms Included
- Bubble sort
- Merge sort
- Insertion sort
- Quick sort
